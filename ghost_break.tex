\title{Weird War: Ghost Break}
\author{DVB}

\section{Intro}
(North Africa, 1942)\\

    PCs are allied 2nd stringers (33rd Lowland Division), worn out from weeks of fighting Rommel in the desert.  Things were finally looking up as Montgomery's Eighth Army clawed back some territory from the Axis.  But Rommel has been desperate, meddling with dark forces and tombs long covered by the sand.  Worse than breaking into such a reliquary is breaking out...

Stuff around the camp, maybe someone telling ghost stories

    Sergeant Slattery, total hardass.  Has authority over PCs (even officers).  Puts them on latrine duty as ``light work''.

All-American Super Squad just leaving, mocking PCs saying they just ``left a deposit'' for the party to clean up.

\subsection{Adventure Limitations}

    War has been straining the 8th Army beyond the breaking point.  Few supplies are available, morale is nearly rock-bottom, and the campaign drags on.  But, they have tasted their first crucial victory and are battled tested veterans.
    
    During this adventure, PCs face the following global modifiers:

    \begin{itemize}
        \item Rationed supplies, \Threat\Threat is enough to run out of ammo or other limited use items (med kits, flares, etc).  Scrounging may recover additional ammo or supplies
        \item Low Morale, \Despair causes all \emph{other} party members to suffer one strain in addition to normal effects
        \item Turning point, Aid Another maneuver adds an extra \Advantage\Advantage in addition to normal benefits
    \end{itemize}

\section{Benign Transposition}

Ghost - ancient spirit, summoned by Rommel's occult detachment.  Unbound since axis retreated, but desperately needs to escape the warded tomb, or PCs will share their fate.

Ghost spends last bit of vigor weirdly teleporting PCs from surface to within tomb.  To get out themselves, PCs need to get Ghost out safely.

\ch\df Resilience to avoid retching at sudden motion
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \Failure Suffer wounds equal to number of failures (min 2)
        \item \Advantage +\bbb to resist the incorporeal check
        \item \Triumph As shifting, either manage to bring useful piece of special equipment with you, or stumble upon some (possibly ancient/occult) immediately
        \item \Despair Some \emph{part} of you is still in the ether.  Upgrade difficulty of incorporeal check.
    \end{itemize}


It is completely dark.  There are no sounds of the typical encampment.  A brief sobbing wail wanes nearby as the Ghost.

Social interaction with Ghost can reveal info about nazi occult experiments and possibly dangers of the tomb, mix of ancient shrines and leftover Nazi occult experiments.

    Ghost brought PCs here as they can help it escape by breaking the ward.  Then Ghost will help them escape the tomb itself.  Possible \textbf{Negotiate}.

    Occult check may reveal nature of Ghost (summoned spirit, not some long-serving guardian).  Powerful but slowly recharging abilities

\ch\df Discipline to maintain corporeal existence
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \Failure Lose full connection to material reality.  +\stb for next encounter as slowly rematerialize completely.
        \item \Advantage See something interesting while phasing.  +\bbb to Perception (may be occult aligned)
        \item \Triumph Limited control of phasing between planes with \df\df\df Discipline check action once per encounter.
        \item \Despair Still phasing in and out.  May phase out at an inopportune time chosen by the GM, lasting for 1 round of structured time
    \end{itemize}

Ghost is bound to this room by occult wards, and will only help PCs out if they let him out.

    \df\df Knowledge (Lore) to ascertain nature of occult wards
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \Success Clearly German design, ideally have occult key to safely remove
        \item \Advantage Key likely to be in higher level of tomb, where PCs can freely go
    \end{itemize}

\df\df\stb\stb Skulduggery to safely break the ward (2 upgrades w/o key)
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \Advantage Able to repurpose some occult component
        \item \Failure Suffer 5 wounds as occult energy zaps you.  Soak does not apply.
        \item \Despair \emph{Something Else} is summoned.  Must face the malign spirit (use Ghost template).
    \end{itemize}

\section{Uphill Battle}

A windy staircase leads up to a larger chamber, dry from thousands of years of desert.  Sand is everywhere, mixed with more recent German equipment.  Curiously, the retreating forces still left a few lights on.

\df\df\stb Perception to search the room for clues
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \Success Find misc electronics and occult equipment (but no key) buried in sand.
        \item \Advantage Strangely large number of dog treats (or maybe lunar diagrams).
        \item \Advantage Westward tunnel was collapsed on purpose, signs of explosives.  And occult residue.
        \item \Threat\Threat disturb a Scarab Swarm (see below)
    \end{itemize}

\npc{Scarab Swarm}{1}{4}{1}{1}{1}{1}{20}{1}
\npccontinued{0}{0}{
   Skills:
   \begin{itemize}
       \item Brawl 2
       \item Coordination 2
   \end{itemize}
   Abilities:
   \begin{itemize}
       \item Sharp mandibles - +2 brawl damage
       \item Swarm - Unless blast or burn, halve damage before applying soak
       \item Venomous Bite - If Scarab Swarm successfully hits a character, that character must make at \df\df Resilience check or be disoriented (+\stb) for 2 rounds.
   \end{itemize}}

Two apparent ways out, tunnel up and tunnel ``west'' (if you have a compass).  Westward tunnel is collapsed in.

\df\df Vigilance to listen for faint yelling
\begin{itemize}
    \item \Advantage It sounds more like howling
\end{itemize}

Ghost can only speculate on the nature of the scarabs.  ``Creatures of hunger, much like men.''

\df\df Lore check to sort out what the heck they're about.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \Success Corpse cleaning scarabs do exist, but these seem to hunger for living flesh.  Dangerous.
        \item \Advantage Large for a bug, but too small to easily hit with a gun, punch, or similar.  (learn about the swarm nature)
        \item \Advantage Bite is venomous, a mild hallucinogen
    \end{itemize}

\section{Prisoners}

In tunnel up, several Germans locked up, looking somewhat haggard.  They plea to be let out.  \df\df Streetwise to understand unless your character narratively speaks German.

Johann, Frederick, Carsten will only volunteer that they're soldiers in the German army.  But they insist they're innocent, just a misunderstanding (if you can understand German).

They are actually the experiments of this tomb.  Occult fusions of human and jackal.  Essentially a werewolf.  These people don't really know that, only bad nitemares.  But they're hardly turning traitor, more interested in getting out alive.  Given the chance, they'll flee.  If PCs turn on them, they may transform (due to rage)

Do PCs even trust these people?  Rommel is known for laying traps; this could be yet another one?

Ghost not a fan of them (either because they're Germans).

\df\df\stb\stb Medicine to inspect the prisoners
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \Success Generally weakened state of hunger, also flea infestations
        \item \Advantage\Advantage Seem to have claws grafted in place of fingernails
        \item \Triumph Extra hair, extended canines, sharp claws, these people will transform under the light of a full moon, or stressful situations.
    \end{itemize}

One prisoner has the occult key (especially if threats on medicine).

\section{Ruined Shrine}

Ruined anubis/jackal statues/sarchophagi

Germans uneasy, may panic.  Can store/spend threats/dark side points to have them (or one of them) transform (or partial transform?  smells like a wet dog?).

Place has been looted of all valuables (\ch\df\stb\stb Perception to look anyway).  But occult key may be found here with success if not found already.

Ghost wistful.  This place was once opulent.  If PCs can extract info from them, learn that it was a shrine to Anubis.  Now desecrated by Germans.  If PCs scrounge too much (\Threat\Threat\Threat or \Despair), Ghost may attack upon discovery.


\section{Collapsed Tunnel}

If engineer an opening, can see mostly clear tunnel heading west.  More recent construction.  Flickering lights.

\df\df Perception to recover useful piece of equipment.

German army planning to pop up a battalion behind Allied lines using this tunnel.  Maybe find note of orders (for retreat and subsequent return 2 days later...i.e. in 4 hours).  They will have almost certainly too much firepower for PCs to withstand, need to warn command.

If haven't found occult key, could be here (with multiple \Advantage).

\section{Surface}

Full moon is out.  Depending how PCs worked with Germans, the former prisoners might transform (and attack).  Otherwise they just make a break for it.

All combat/visual checks by humans suffer \stb due to darkness.

Shifting sand provides small pieces of ruined cover.

\newpage

\section{Secret Backgrounds}

\subsection{Woman in Disguise}

You are actually a woman in disguise as a man.  You are determined to do your part in this war, directly.  Being found out would mean court martial, imprisonment, or worse.

Start with a disguise kit (+\bbb to Cool, other uses as narratively appropriate).

\subsection{German Ancestry}

Though you are German by birth, you have no sympathy for the atrocities committed by your homeland.  But, no one trusts a turncoat, so you insist any accent is actually from an obscure central European country.  Everyone seems to believe you, but you can feel their doubts.

Your character speaks fluent German.

\subsection{Communist Sympathizer}

While the USSR is officially an equal partner in the Allies, a cloud of suspicion hangs over them.  While not Russian yourself, you feel the plight of the workers and take direction from ComIntern.  But such talk in the wrong ears could mean expulsion or worse.

Start with a smoke grenade (Maneuver to use, add 2 Defense to everyone within short range, or \bbb\bbb to Stealth checks).

\subsection{Pacifist}

You support resisting Fascism, but you know war is wrong.  You do all you can to prevent violence, but direct opposition to the war will only get you imprisoned, at best.

Start with a medkit (+\bbb to Medicine, 3 encumbrance).

\section{Secret Goals}

\subsection{Hunt Treasure}

War is hell and pay is crap, but you can come out ahead.  Rather than let valuables be looted or scrapped for more tanks, you should keep them safe.  It belongs in a museum (or maybe your bank account).

Start with a whip (+1 dmg Melee, up to short range, Ensnare 1 (spend \Advantage\Advantage on a successful check to keep target from moving for 1 round)).  Also usable narratively for Atheletics, Coordination, and other skill checks.

\subsection{Take Revenge}

The Wehrmacht has taken so much from you, family, friends, or livelihood.  But the tide of war is finally turning.  It's time to make the Germans pay for what they did.

One of your weapons gains Vicious 2 (+20 to crit results).

\subsection{Build a Legend}

Sun Tzu.  Alexander the Great.  The Red Baron.  You might be mortal, but your name can live on forever in your deeds.  Do something unbelievable that people will remember.

Once per session, add 2 boost dice (+\bbb\bbb) to a dice pool before you roll.

\subsection{Protect the Flock}

The bond with your squadmates is tighter than blood.  You've lost one member already; you cannot bear even the thought of losing another.  You will do whatever you can to ensure everyone survives the war.

When you take the Aid Another maneuver or receive aid, add an extra Boost die (\bbb) to the pool.

\section{Recoverable Equipment}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Extra Ammo
    \item Medkit refill
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Rifle}

Sniper Rifle (8 dmg, Ranged-Heavy, Long Range, Crit 2, Accurate 1, Encumbrance 4)

\subsection{Pistol}

Heavy Pistol (6 dmg, Ranged-Light, Medium Range, Crit 3, Accurate 1, Encumbrance 2)

\subsection{Shield}

Occult Shield (+0 dmg, Melee, Engaged, Crit 5, +2 Defense, Encumbrance 3)

\subsection{Maul}

War Hammer (+3 dmg, Melee, Engaged, Crit 3, Disorient 3, Vicious 1, Encumbrance 3)
