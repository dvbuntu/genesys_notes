\maketitle

\begin{multicols}{2}

\gb is an adventure module using the GeneSys RPG system and dice.  It is set in a variant of the \emph{Weird War} setting, an alternative history World War 2 universe with occult elements.

Four pregenerated characters are provided, as well as four secret backgrounds and four secret goals.  After players have chosen their characters, randomly distribute one background and one goal to each player.  They should not directly share this information with other players, but it may come out narratively during gameplay.

\section{Intro}
(North Africa, 1942)\\

    The PCs are allied 2nd stringers (33rd Lowland Division), worn out from weeks of fighting Rommel in the desert.  Things were finally looking up as Montgomery's Eighth Army clawed back some territory from the Axis.  But Rommel has been desperate, meddling with dark forces and tombs long covered by the sand.  Worse than breaking into such a reliquary is breaking out...

    Sergeant Slattery brooks no nonsense and has authority over PCs (even officers).  He orders them on latrine duty as ``light work''.

    The All-American Super Squad (AASS) is just leaving, mocking PCs saying they just ``left a deposit'' for the party to clean up.  They chest bump, high five, and set out for a night of unsanctioned partying in the encampment. 

\subsection{Adventure Limitations}

    War has been straining the 8th Army beyond the breaking point.  Few supplies are available, morale is nearly rock-bottom, and the campaign drags on.  But, they have tasted their first crucial victory and are battled tested veterans.
    
    During this adventure, PCs face the following global modifiers:

    \begin{itemize}
        \item Rationed Supplies, \Threat\Threat is enough to run out of ammo or other limited use items (med kits, flares, etc).  Scrounging may recover additional ammo or supplies
        \item Low Morale, \Despair causes all \emph{other} party members to suffer one strain in addition to normal effects
        \item Turning Point, Aid Another maneuver adds an extra \Advantage\Advantage in addition to normal benefits
    \end{itemize}

\section{Benign Transposition}

As the PCs head toward the latrine, they suddenly feel a twisting motion.  Everything goes black.

\ch\df Resilience to avoid retching at sudden motion
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \Failure Suffer wounds equal to number of failures (min 2)
        \item \Advantage +\bbb to resist the incorporeal check
        \item \Triumph As shifting, either manage to bring useful piece of special equipment with you, or stumble upon some (possibly ancient/occult) immediately
        \item \Despair Some \emph{part} of you is still in the ether.  Upgrade difficulty of incorporeal check.
    \end{itemize}

    Ghost - ancient spirit, now a Tortured Soul, summoned by Rommel's occult detachment (GeisterTruppen).  It is unbound since the Axis retreated, but it is unable to escape the warded tomb, or PCs will share their fate.  Ghost may choose to lie and claim to be a former human transformed by the Germans.  

Ghost spent last bit of vigor weirdly teleporting PCs from surface to within tomb.  It is stuck in a warded circle in this room.  Some kind of occult key could safely free it.  To get out of this tomb themselves, PCs need to get Ghost out safely or find their own way.

\end{GenesysTable}\\
   }


It is completely dark.  There are no sounds of the typical encampment.  A brief sobbing wail wanes nearby.

Social interaction with Ghost can reveal info about Nazi occult experiments and possibly dangers of the tomb: a mix of ancient shrines and leftover experiments.

    Ghost brought the PCs here as they can help it escape by breaking the ward.  Then Ghost calls out to them, will to help them escape the tomb itself if they break him out of the ward.  Possible \textbf{Negotiate}.

    \df\df Lore check may reveal nature of Ghost (summoned spirit, not some long-serving guardian).  It is powerful but has slowly recharging abilities.

    Once PCs have spent some amount of time after the transposition, their materiality hopefully stabilizes, possibly violently.  The transposition may not have been so benign.

\ch\df Discipline to stabilize corporeal existence
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \Failure Lose full connection to material reality.  +\stb for next encounter as slowly rematerialize completely.
        \item \Advantage See something interesting while phasing.  +\bbb to Perception (may be occult aligned)
        \item \Triumph Limited control of phasing between planes with \df\df\df Discipline check action once per encounter.
        \item \Despair Still phasing in and out.  May phase out at an inopportune time chosen by the GM, lasting for 1 round of structured time
    \end{itemize}

Ghost is bound to this room by occult wards, and will only help PCs out if they undo the wards.

    \df\df Knowledge (Lore) to ascertain nature of occult wards
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \Success Clearly German design, ideally have occult key to safely remove
        \item \Advantage Key likely to be in higher level of tomb, where PCs can freely go
    \end{itemize}

\df\df\stb\stb Skulduggery to safely break the ward (2 upgrades w/o key)
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \Advantage Able to repurpose some occult component
        \item \Failure Suffer 5 wounds as occult energy zaps you.  Soak does not apply.
        \item \Despair \emph{Something Else} is summoned.  Must face the malign spirit (use Ghost template).
    \end{itemize}

\section{Uphill Battle}

A stone staircase leads up to a larger chamber, dry from thousands of years of desert.  Sand is everywhere, mixed with more recent German equipment.  Curiously, the retreating forces still left a few lights on.

\df\df\stb Perception to search the room for clues
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \Success Find misc electronics and occult equipment (but no key) buried in sand.
        \item \Advantage Strangely large number of dog treats (or maybe lunar diagrams).
        \item \Advantage Westward tunnel was collapsed on purpose, signs of explosives.  And occult residue.
        \item \Threat\Threat disturb a Scarab Swarm (see below)
    \end{itemize}

\npc{Scarab Swarm [Rival]}{1}{4}{1}{1}{1}{1}{20}{1}

\begin{GenesysTable}{ll}
    Skills & \\

\begin{GenesysTable}{ll}
    Abilities & \\
       Sharp mandibles & +2 brawl damage \\

       &        check or be disoriented (+\stb) for 2 rounds.\\
\end{GenesysTable}
   }

There are two apparent ways out, tunnel up and tunnel ``east'' (if you have a compass).  A westward tunnel is collapsed in, but may be cleared with effort.

\df\df Vigilance to listen for faint yelling or hear German radio static from tunnel
\begin{itemize}
    \item \Advantage It sounds more like howling
\end{itemize}

Ghost can only speculate on the nature of the scarabs.  ``Creatures of hunger, much like men.''

\df\df Lore check to sort out what the heck they're about.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \Success Corpse cleaning scarabs do exist, but these seem to hunger for living flesh.  Dangerous.
        \item \Advantage Large for a bug, but too small to easily hit with a gun, punch, or similar.  (learn about the swarm nature)
        \item \Advantage Bite is venomous, a mild hallucinogen
    \end{itemize}

\section{Prisoners}

In the tunnel up, several Germans are locked up, looking somewhat haggard with torn uniforms.  They plea to be let out.  \df\df Streetwise to understand their meaning unless your character narratively speaks German.

Johann, Frederick, Carsten will only volunteer that they're soldiers in the German army.  But they insist they're innocent, just a misunderstanding (if you can understand German).

They are actually the experiments of this tomb.  Occult fusions of human and jackal, essentially a werewolf.  These people don't really know that, only that they have bad nightmares.  But they're hardly turning traitor, being more interested in getting out alive.  Given the chance, they'll flee.  If PCs turn on them, they may transform (due to rage).

Do PCs even trust these people?  Rommel is known for laying traps; could this be yet another one?

Ghost is not a fan of the Germans, making no distinction between prisoners and captors.

\df\df\stb\stb Medicine to inspect the prisoners
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \Success Generally weakened state of hunger, also flea infestations
        \item \Advantage\Advantage Seem to have claws grafted in place of fingernails
        \item \Triumph Extra hair, extended canines, sharp claws, these people will transform under the light of a full moon, or stressful situations.
    \end{itemize}

One prisoner has the occult key (especially if threats on the Medicine check).

\section{Ruined Shrine}

In the eastern tunnel, there is a ruined shrine.  It has several jackal statues and sarchophagi.

If the Germans are with the PCs, they are uneasy and may panic.  The GM can store/spend threats/dark side points to have them (or one of them) transform and attack.  Panic tends to spread...

This shrine has been looted of all valuables (\ch\df\stb\stb Perception to look anyway).  But the occult key may be found here with success if not found already.

Ghost, if present, is wistful.  This place was once opulent.  If PCs can extract info from them, they learn that it was a shrine to Anubis, now desecrated by Germans.  If PCs scrounge too much (\Threat\Threat\Threat or \Despair), Ghost may attack upon discovery.


\section{Collapsed Tunnel}

If the PCs can engineer an opening, they will see a mostly clear tunnel heading west.  This is more modern construction with flickering lights.

\df\df Perception to recover useful Wehrmacht orders in the rubble.

The German army is planning to pop up a battalion behind Allied lines using this tunnel.  PC may find Wehrmacht orders (for retreat and subsequent return 2 days later...i.e. in 4 hours).  The Germans will have almost certainly too much firepower for the PCs to withstand; they need to warn command.  With \Advantage\Advantage, PCs can also recover a useful piece of equipment (choose randomly or appropriate to the character).

If they haven't found the occult key, it could be here (with multiple \Advantage).

\df\df\df Athletics to clear the tunnel.  Find a dead German trooper along the way.  
If the prisoners or Ghost are with the PCs, they each reduce the difficulty of clearing the tunnel by one.

\df\df Perception to hear GeisterTruppen moving about, carrying equipment.

The tunnel opens to an intersection.  One way leads to a hatch to the surface (where trooper is carrying things).  Another leads deeper into German territory.  The last leads to an equipment room with GeisterTruppen occult materiel.

\df\df Stealth to sneak (to hatch or equipment room)

In the equipment room, \df\df Lore or \df\df\stb Education to assess what the Germans are storing here.  It is spirit binding (and releasing) tools.  With success, you can recover a Ghostbusters-style portable containment unit (complete with foot pedal).  Deploy at your own risk.

\section{Surface}

A full moon is out.  Depending on how the PCs worked with Germans, the former prisoners might transform (and attack).  Otherwise they just make a break for it.

All combat/visual checks by humans suffer \stb due to darkness.  Shifting sand provides small pieces of ruined cover.

\end{GenesysTable}
   }

Depending where they emerge, the PCs may also find a squad of GeisterTruppen setting up some occult equipment behind Allied lines.  They look to be nearly done!

\end{GenesysTable}
   }


\vskip1cm
Ghost, if present, may help, hinder, or ignore, depending on what PCs did.

If the PCs manage to stop the GeisterTruppen, the Allied lines are safe.  If, however, the equipment itself became too far damaged, vengeful spirits may escape and possess Allied soldiers, like the AASS.

\section{Secret Backgrounds}

\subsection{Woman in Disguise}

You are actually a woman in disguise as a man.  You are determined to do your part in this war, directly.  Being found out would mean court martial, imprisonment, or worse.

Start with a disguise kit (+\bbb to Cool, other uses as narratively appropriate).

\subsection{German Ancestry}

Though you are German by birth, you have no sympathy for the atrocities committed by your homeland.  But, no one trusts a turncoat, so you insist any accent is actually from an obscure central European country.  Everyone seems to believe you, but you can feel their doubts.

Your character speaks fluent German.

\subsection{Communist Sympathizer}

While the USSR is officially an equal partner in the Allies, a cloud of suspicion hangs over them.  While not Russian yourself, you feel the plight of the workers and take direction from ComIntern.  But such talk in the wrong ears could mean expulsion or worse.

Start with a smoke grenade (Maneuver to use, add 2 Defense to everyone within short range, or \bbb\bbb to Stealth checks).

%\subsection{Pacifist}
%
%You support resisting Fascism, but you know war is wrong.  You do all you can to prevent violence, but direct opposition to the war will only get you imprisoned, at best.
%
%Start with a medkit (+\bbb to Medicine, 3 encumbrance).

\subsection{Touched by Supernatural}

One of your parents was a Faerie, a creature of magic.  They mysteriously disappeared just before the war started.  You mostly pass for human, but if the wrong person finds you, you'll become another experiment.

Start with Light of Frame ability (+\bbb to Coordination, other uses as appropriate).

\section{Secret Goals}

\subsection{Hunt Treasure}

War is hell and pay is crap, but you can come out ahead.  Rather than let valuables be looted or scrapped for more tanks, you should keep them safe.  It belongs in a museum (or maybe your bank account).

Start with a satchel (+2 Encumbrance threshold) and rope.

%whip (+1 dmg Melee, up to short range, Ensnare 1 (spend \Advantage\Advantage on a successful check to keep target from moving for 1 round)).  Also usable narratively for Atheletics, Coordination, and other skill checks.

\subsection{Take Revenge}

The Wehrmacht has taken so much from you: family, friends, or livelihood.  But the tide of war is finally turning.  It's time to make the Nazis pay for what they did.

One of your weapons gains Vicious 2 (+20 to crit results).

\subsection{Build a Legend}

Sun Tzu.  Alexander the Great.  The Red Baron.  You might be mortal, but your name can live on forever in your deeds.  Do something unbelievable that people will remember.

Once per session, add 2 boost dice (+\bbb\bbb) to a dice pool before you roll.

\subsection{Protect the Flock}

The bond with your squadmates is tighter than blood.  You've lost one member already; you cannot bear even the thought of losing another.  You will do whatever you can to ensure everyone survives the war.

When you take the Aid Another maneuver or receive aid, add an extra Boost die (\bbb) to the pool.

\section{Recoverable Equipment}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Extra Ammo
    \item Medkit refill
    \item Painkiller
    \item Rope
    \item Lantern
    \item Compass
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Rifle}

Sniper Rifle (8 dmg, Ranged-Heavy, Long Range, Crit 2, Accurate 1, Encumbrance 4)

\subsection{Pistol}

Heavy Pistol (6 dmg, Ranged-Light, Medium Range, Crit 3, Accurate 1, Encumbrance 2)

\subsection{Shield}

Occult Shield (+0 dmg, Melee, Engaged, Crit 5, +2 Defense, Encumbrance 3)

\subsection{Maul}

War Hammer (+3 dmg, Melee, Engaged, Crit 3, Disorient 3, Vicious 1, Encumbrance 3)
