\section{Gemini Mountains}

\emph{Present Day, 1991, the small town of Gemini Mountains.  Can a struggling company of paranormal investigators locate a lost lover while evading corporately-cursed clothing?  Tune in to find out!  Thursdays 8PM Eastern/7PM Central on ABC.  PG-13.}\\

    The Curse of \ai is a Genesys adventure for 3-5 Player Characters (PCs) with a typical playtime of 3 hours.  Inspired by 1990s supernatural television like \emph{Twin Peaks}, \emph{Buffy The Vampire Slayer}, \emph{The X-Files}, and others, the setting is mundane except the PCs and select adversaries are familiar with supernatural forces that lurk beneath public awareness.

\section{Adventure Overview}

    The PCs are a band of paranomal investigators/exterminators hired by Andre to search for his missing boyfriend, Breaux.  In doing so, they uncover Breaux's connection to Advanced Biotech Corporation (ABC) and the heavily marketed \ai clothing product line.  The PCs will find that deploying \ai has some serious consequences for everyone involved.\\
\\
\emph{Goal}: Discover what happened to Breaux and uncover the Curse of \ai.\\
\\
\emph{Challenge}: (spoiler) \ai is a supernatural product that requires skill ``donations'' to grant those skills to others.  Breaux fell into debt using their products unsuccessfully, so ABC has ``repossessed'' him to work that off.\\

\section{Title Sequence}

To help players visualize the setting and get into character, start with an almost literal title sequence of a news piece about/ABC ad for \ai.  Read the below text:

\emph{The camera zooms in on a reporter interviewing the winner of the local Gemini Mountains marathon, an unfamiliar woman wearing bright blue leggings.  She is frenetic, unable to stand still as she explains, ``  ''.  An awkward smile crosses her face as she stutters a goodbye and starts a victory lap, seemingly unable to stop her legs from running.
The camera briefly pans over to another marathoner, exhausted and drained, leaning against a wall.  You recognize her as the previous three-time marathon winner in town.  Smash cut to the character intro sequences.}

Ask one of the PCs to briefly describe their introductory sequence as though it were television show.  This should be a brief shot of the character doing something key to their concept, without dialogue, and unrelated to the current adventure.  After they describe their character, ask the next player and so on.

\emph{Example Introduction 1}: Candra the witch is sitting cross-legged in a pentagram.  Five candles sit unlit at each point of the star.  One suddenly flickers to life as we see it reflected in Candra's eyes.
\emph{Example Introduction 2}: Sebastian the engineer is typing furiously at a bulky 1990s laptop computer.  The camera rotates around the scene to show ``Ghost Program Activated'' on the screen as Sebastian grins.

After all characters have introduced themselves, the show title appears, displaying,``The Curse of \ai''.
