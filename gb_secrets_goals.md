# Secret Background

## Woman in Disguise

Your character is actually a woman in disguise as a man.  She is determined to do her part in this war, directly.  Being found out would mean court martial, imprisonment, or worse.

## German Ancestry

Though you are German by birth, you have no sympathy for the atrocities committed by your homeland.  But, no one trusts a turncoat, so you insist any accent is actually from an obscure central European country.  Everyone seems to believe you, but you can feel their doubts.

## Communist Sympathizer

While the USSR is officially an equal partner in the Allies, a cloud of suspicion hangs over them.  While not Russian yourself, you feel the plight of the workers and take direction from ComIntern.  But such talk in the wrong ears could mean expulsion or worse.

## Pacifist

You support resisting Fascism, but you know war is wrong.  You do all you can to prevent violence, but direct opposition to the war will only get you imprisoned, at best.

# Secret Goal

## Treasure Hunter

War is hell and pay is crap, but you can come out ahead.  Rather than let valuables be looted or scrapped for more tanks, you should keep them safe.  It belongs in a museum (or maybe your bank account).

## Personal Revenge

The Wehrmacht has taken so much from you, family, friends, or livelihood.  But the tide of war is finally turning.  It's time to may the Germans pay for what they did.

## Build a Legend

Sun Tzu.  Alexander the Great.  The Red Baron.  You might be mortal, but your name can live on forever in your deeds.  Do something unbelievable that people will remember.

## Protect the Flock

The bond with your squadmates is tighter than blood.  You've lost one member already; you cannot bear even the thought of losing another.  You will do whatever you can to ensure everyone survives the war.
