\section{XCOM}

Hello, Commander.  The year is 1974, and aliens are starting to secretly infiltrate our society.  XCOM has not been fully activated; we need to identify capable recruits, preferably those some experience dealing with aliens.  Please review the below After Action Report to determine if the student group from Ares University should be inducted into an XCOM cell.

\section{Adventure Overview}

    The Player Characters (PCs) are graduate students at Ares University in the same research group supervised by \prof.  They are all going together to a research conference in West Berlin.  While there, however, \prof asks that they recover critical research equipment from allegedly Nazi scientists.  The PCs may find, however, that the equipment, scientists, and even \prof are not entirely what they seem.

\emph{Goal}: Recover critical research equipment so it does not fall into the ``wrong'' hands.\\
\emph{Challenge}: (spoiler) \prof is actually an alien infiltrator.  She is using the PCs to steal equipment as her alien form would be detected.  And the ``device'' is actually an awoken psychic human who could be a threat to alien infiltrators.\\

\subsection{Encounter List}
\begin{enumerate}
    \setlength\itemsep{-.8em}
    \item Dead Student (information)
    \item Conference Arrival (social)
    \item Biokinetic Waveform Analyzer (social/information)
    \item Crossing The Border (social/stealth/physical)
    \item Facility Infiltration (social/stealth)
    \item Entity Extraction (stealth/combat)
    \item Research Defense (social/combat)
    \item Aftermath
\end{enumerate}

\section{Dead Student}

Start the session by noting that one member of \prof's research group recently died on campus, supposedly due to a medical condition.  Their death was sudden and no one seemed to be aware of a problem before.  If one of the characters was not chosen by the players, make it that one.  Otherwise, ask the players each one detail about the now deceased student.

    This encounter is primarily for the characters to establish Ares University and become more comfortable in the Cold War setting.  Each PC has an opportunity to use one skill to learn a little about what happened to their colleague before they head to the conference.  If they're unsure what to try, here are some possibilities:

    \vspace{1em}
\begin{GenesysTable}{p{1.5in}p{2in}}
    Approach & \\
    \df\df \textbf{Charm} the Nurses Group & Paramedics who declared
    student dead were not the usual crew\\
    \df\df \textbf{Streetwise} at Hades Club & Rumor is that student
    was poisoned\\
        \df\df \textbf{Stealth} to check \prof's office & Student had meeting with \prof just before death\\
    \df\df \textbf{Knowledge (Lore)} \hskip1em in Student's Room & ``Conspiracy Board'' suggests Student found out some secret about \prof \\
\end{GenesysTable}

The PCs might talk to \prof.  She is an older woman, possibly in her seventies with light tan, almost leathery, skin.  She has only one leg and so gets around in a wheelchair.  Her slight central European accent and disability fuel rumors that she was a Nazi scientist during the war, but escaped to the Allies when it ended as part of Operation Paperclip.  She never directly answers questions about that time, and most people are polite enough not to ask.

If the PCs ask \prof about the death directly, she demurs, ``I understand this is hard on all of us.  But they would have wanted us to honor their memory by furthering our research.  Are you all set to travel to Berlin?''

}

\prof is really an alien Viper (i.e. snake person) masquerading as a scientist.  She actually did infiltrate the Third Reich as they were the first human nation to somewhat successfully make alien contact.  She has no interest in that ideology, but it provided a cover for her to continue infiltrating after the war.  Her one leg is actually a cover for her snake-like tail.  Alien genetic engineering is only so attuned to humans at this point, so she takes care to keep it hidden.  Her name is always rendered in lowercase, as ``allen'' very nearly ``alien'', though no-one in-universe should consider this unusual.

The dead student had discovered her identity (or something close to it), so she killed them with her venom and covered it up.  She \emph{is} ruthless, but her mission is primarily infiltration and preventing leaks of alien information.

\section{Conference Arrival}

The PCs are attending the "Conference on Physical Psychology" held in West Berlin.  This is a very diverse but academic conference.  There will be talks and researchers at a variety of technical levels and disciplines.  The PCs are staying at the hotel co-located with the conference.

After settling into their rooms (\df\df Social check if a PC wants to share a room with \prof), \prof speaks to them furtively,

\begin{quoting}
    I'm glad all of you are able to attend this conference, but I have small favor to ask.  Another research group is presenting ideas on a Biokinetic Waveform Analyzer.  This is extremely dangerous technology, and they've secretly been working on a prototype.  We can't let this technology fall into the \emph{wrong hands}.  I need you to find and recover the prototype.
\end{quoting}

If the PCs ask questions, have them make a \df\df social check (probably \textbf{Charm}, but it depends on how they ask).  Even though this is against \prof, don't upgrade this check as she is expecting them to want a few more details.

On Success:
\begin{itemize}
    \setlength\itemsep{-.8em}
    \item ``The researchers experimenting with this technology are some of my...former colleagues in the Reich.  But they were true believers; the bastards will use it to raise a Fourth Reich!''
    \item \Advantage \prof also shares, ``During the war, the Nazis made many dangerous scientific advances.  Their remnants, my former colleagues, are trying to deploy this technology to restore their empire.  I represent an extranational organization, EXCALIBUR, dedicated to stopping them.''
    \item \Triumph \prof advises that the Nazis scientists likely have a captive connected to their research.
    \item \Threat\Threat PCs may make a \df\df \textbf{Vigilance} check to notice someone slipping away nearby.  They must have been listening to their conversation.
\end{itemize}

If not already mentioned, \prof thanks the PCs,

\begin{quoting}
    I appreciate your initiative in this matter.  I hate to have to involve you, but they know me well, and I'm not as spry as I once was.  You might start at the presentation tomorrow morning.  Your efforts will ensure the future of the planet.
\end{quoting}

\section{Biokinetic Waveform Analyzer}

As the conference proper begins, the PCs should try to learn more about the dangerous technology.  While attending the official talk (titled, ``Biokinetic Waveform Analyzer'') is an obvious idea, there are several possible ways to learn more.  Feel free to mix what approach yields what information, and offer more with \Advantage.  These can be single rolls or more extended encounters depending on player interest.

    \begin{GenesysTable}{p{1.5in}p{2in}}
    Approach & \\
        \ch\df \textbf{Knowledge (Science)} to understand talk & Technology could detect lifeforms and basic information about them.\\
    \df\df\df \textbf{Charm} to schmooze with academics & Technology has extreme computational cost, far beyond current capabilities. \\
    \df\df \textbf{Perception} to eavesdrop rumors & Device is being held in East Berlin, to be transferred tomorrow morning.\\
    \ch\df \textbf{Skulduggery} to access back room of conference & Find device storage address, warehouse in East Berlin.  Soon to ship to Moscow.  \\
\end{GenesysTable}

The Biokinetic Waveform Analyzer (BWA) talk, presented by Dr. Werner Strauss, is incredibly technical but mostly about applications rather than theory.  Some of the other academic attendees ask condescending questions pointing out that the ideas presented lack theoretical foundations.  The room is nearly full, though space is available to stand in the back.

If PCs roll too much {\Threat } in their investigation, they may draw attention from the BWA ``research team''.  While this includes scientists, there are a number of military types as well.  They might question the PCs, or just keep a closer eye on them and better guard their information.

If the PCs aren't able to find the location of the device nor the time-sensitive nature of the task, \prof can inform them.  She explains that EXCALIBUR was able to come through with some critical intel.

\section{Crossing The Border}

The PCs need to find a way across the Berlin Wall (and back).  Border guards are incredibly strict, and Stasi informants watch everything in East Germany.  If, however, playing time is limited, this scene can be cut.  Just reframe the facility as actually being in \emph{West} Berlin, and it's about to be moved east.

PCs may want to gather information about approaches to safely traversing the border.  Here are a few options they might consider, condensed into groups of skill checks that are likely to flow together.

\df\df\stb \textbf{Perception} and \df\df \textbf{Stealth} to find smuggling tunnels and maybe meet a ``Fluchthelfer'' who maintains one:
    \begin{itemize}
    \setlength\itemsep{-.5em}
        \item \Advantage\Advantage: A contact in East Germany is willing to help the PCs if they take them back with them on the westward journey.
        \item \Triumph: The tunnel is untested, and possibly unwatched.  No \textbf{Stealth} check required on the other side.
        \item \Threat\Threat: The tunnel starts flooding, triggering an Easy [\df] Fear check.
        \item \Despair: Stasi demolitions teams explode the tunnel just as PCs are exiting.  \df\df \textbf{Coordination} or \textbf{Vigilance} to avoid a Critical Injury.  And a new way back will have to be found.
    \end{itemize}

\df\df \textbf{Streetwise} and \ch\df social check to obtain forged papers allowing travel:
    \begin{itemize}
    \setlength\itemsep{-.5em}
        \item \Advantage\Advantage: The PCs learn about a sympathetic border guard who can be pressured if need be.
        \item \Triumph:  The papers are actually legitimate and include protection against search and seizure (still true if failed, the guards just don't believe it).
        \item \Threat\Threat: Random inspections add \stb to the social check to get passed border guards.
        \item \Despair: The border is closed due to visiting dignitaries.  If succeeded \textbf{Streetwise} roll, upgrade the social check difficulty.
    \end{itemize}

Additional threats on the secondary roll may mean that Stasi informants are following the PCs.  At an inconvenient moment during the warehouse encounter, they or other agents may appear, complicating the situation further.

\section{Facility Infiltration}

The warehouse holding the device is patrolled by several lookouts.  \df\df\stb Perception will reveal that these are low-level local hires, not the militant BWA ``research team'' members.  PCs might take a variety of approaches to get past them and inside.  Here are a few possibilities:

    \begin{GenesysTable}{p{1.9in}p{1.5in}}
    Approach & \\
        \df\df \textbf{Stealth} + \df\df\df \textbf{Athletics} to scale unseen part of wall. & Leads to roof or window entrance with easier Perception checks inside.\\
        \df\df \textbf{Stealth} + \df\df\stb \textbf{Skulduggery} to sneakto side door and lockpick. & Leads to side entrance with better cover. \\
        \df\df\df Social (any reasonable) to lie/buy/bully way past guards. & PCs get in but are seen by scientists/BWA militants. \\
\end{GenesysTable}

If the PCs gain entry without being observed (i.e. successful \textbf{Stealth}y approaches), they can observe and hear parts of a private conversation.  A scientist is arguing with the militant \textbf{Viktor Roman}, an untrusting German, about the device.  Despite the risks, Viktor insists that ``sacrifices have to be made'' to ``stamp out the snakes''.  In addition to Viktor, there are 2 minion groups of field scientists (2-3 each) and 1/2 additional military-style personal (use Viktor's stat block with all skills reduced to 1 rank and no special abilities).  Distractions set by the PCs earlier may call some of these forces away, but Viktor and at least one scientist group will always be present.

Viktor and the scientists \emph{are} the remnants of the German group which first made contact with aliens as \prof alleged, but they are not ideologically aligned.   They have developed a working BWA, a coffin-sized device capable of detecting space aliens.  And they are not keen on giving the BWA up, as they are preparing to deploy it in Moscow.  To fulfill \prof's request, however, the PCs need to acquire the BWA and bring it back across the border.  This is the last chance before it moves irrevocably beyond the Iron Curtain.

   }

Viktor and his security detail are willing to fight over the BWA and they are resolute in their mission to take it to Moscow.  The scientists, however, may waver and could be susceptible to social combat (or a single check if time is limited).  If the security detail goes down, all remaining scientists will surrender.

\section{Entity Extraction}

What the PCs don't know, and what Viktor is loathe to reveal, is that the \emph{BWA contains a psychically active human being}, Edith.  Her capabilities circumvent the computational limitations  hinted at in the academic lecture.  She is in apparent stasis within the device, clearly visible once PCs are standing next to it.  She is connected to a variety of IVs and electrodes; it does not look pleasant.

A quick \df\df\df\bbb \textbf{Coercion} or \df\df\df\bbb \textbf{Leadership} against a scientist will reveal that Edith is being used against her will.  She was originally a volunteer, but Viktor took things too far.  He even sent the only key to the device ahead to Moscow already, so it can only be legitimately opened there.

To free Edith, the PCs will have to safely pick the high security lock on the BWA or otherwise smash the device and risk hurting her.  Scientists, if cowed, will use \textbf{Expert Instruction} to assist by upgrading up to 2 PC checks.

Two separate successful checks are required to extract Edith without injury:

\df\df\df\stb \textbf{Skulduggery} or \df\df\df\df \textbf{Mechanics} to physically open the BWA:
    \begin{itemize}
    \setlength\itemsep{-.5em}
        \item \Failure: PCs will have to try another method.  The medical extraction check is upgraded once for failed check beyond the first.  After 3 total failures, they may simply smash open the device and accept the upgraded difficulty.
        \item \Advantage\Advantage: The PCs recover data of recent readings showing alien activity at the conference.
        \item \Threat\Threat: Add \stb to the medical extraction check as there are more IVs than previously seen tethering Edith to the BWA.
        \item \Despair: Electrical current arcs across the device, jolting the PC and making them suffer a Critical Injury.
    \end{itemize}

\df\df\stb \textbf{Medicine} to safely unplug Edith from an array of tubes:
    \begin{itemize}
    \setlength\itemsep{-.5em}
        \item \Failure: Edith is deeply implanted into the device.  They can forcibly cut her out, but she will suffer 2 Critical Injuries.
        \item \Advantage: Edith becomes alert and recognizes the PCs are trying to free her.  Add \bbb from her help.
        \item \Threat\Threat: Edith becomes alert and misconstrues the PCs as further binding her.  Add \stb from her resistance.
        \item \Despair:  Edith's psychic abilities suddenly attack the PCs.  Each PC in short range must make \df\df\df \textbf{Vigilance} or \ch\df\df \textbf{Resilience} to avoid a Critical Injury.
    \end{itemize}

Once out and calm, Edith is generally disposed to help the PCs.  She will freely travel with them to connect with \prof.  She despises the scientists, even if they helped the PCs.  They could have freed her earlier but did not; so she will not travel with them.  She is also somewhat mentally unbalanced by psychic conditioning, aggressively demanding, ``Where are the snakes?'' when she comes to.

        Stupefy & \df\df\df, Psionics, Short, Spell, stagger target \\
\end{GenesysTable}\\
}

The party will have to sneak back into West Berlin, but this can be handled more succinctly than the earlier crossing.  If they had used official papers, it may be a problem to have an extra person.  Edith, however, can deploy her abilities should the need arise.

\section{Research Defense}

If Edith is awake when the PCs return to \prof, she will have a severe reaction when within Medium range of the professor.  For narrative emphasis, this can be on the other side of a hotel room door, or with some other divider obscuring \prof as the immediate source of the reaction.  Being in such close proximity, Edith is unable to function clearly.  The PCs must act.

If the PCs accuse \prof of being an alien, she will become hostile.  She gets two turns in a round (one in her initiative slot and one at the end).  These turns should do different things, like one spent spitting and one spent binding.  Also note that she is immune to her own acid.

Even if the PCs hand over Edith (who will resist if out of the device and alert), \prof may still distrust them as knowing too much.  They must pass a \ch\df\df\stb \textbf{Cool} or \textbf{Deception} check to play dumb.  Upgrade the difficulty if they rescued Edith but did not bring her to \prof:
    \begin{itemize}
    \setlength\itemsep{-.5em}
        \item \Failure: \prof decides the PCs know too much and attacks.
        \item \Advantage\Advantage: \prof is momentarily distracted and will take \stb on the initiative check.
        \item \Triumph: Edith or one of the PCs get a surprise attack on \prof
        \item \Threat\Threat: \prof also has an Alien Pistol (7 dmg, Medium, Crit 4, Burn 1).  It will not fire for humans if captured.
        \item \Despair:  Edith loses control and cannot tell friend from foe during the combat.
    \end{itemize}

If the PCs succeed in fooling \prof, they may choose to set a trap or string her along for more information in the long run.  Edith will urge the PCs to capture \prof so they can interrogate her and learn more.

\section{Aftermath}

Before the PCs can fly home, they are suddenly woken up during the night.  Extremely bright lights allow them to see only dark silhouettes of a number of soldiers on the other side of the lights.  The one nearest to the PCs flatly states, ``I understand you've seen some things not of this Earth.  We could use skills and resilience like yours...''.  The XCOM operative will ask the PCs to keep an eye on \prof if she is still trusting, or take her into custody if she has been subdued.  This could be the opening of a longer campaign uncovering and dealing with alien threats at Ares University before formal induction as an XCOM cell.

Recommended XP: 10 XP for reaching the BWA/Edith.  10 XP for freeing her and confronting \prof.  Bonus 5 XP each if they befriend a BWA scientist or \emph{capture} \prof.
