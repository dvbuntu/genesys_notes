\section{Opening Crawl}

Hello, Commander.  The year is 1974, and aliens are starting to secretly infiltrate our society.  XCOM has not been fully activated; we need to identify capable recruits, preferably those some experience dealing with aliens.  Please review the below After Action Report to determine if the student group from Ares University should be inducted into an XCOM cell.

\section{Adventure Overview }

    The Player Characters (PCs) are graduate students in the same research group supervised by \prof.  They are all going together to a research conference in West Berlin.  While there, however, \prof asks that they recover critical research equipment from allegedly Nazi scientists.  The PCs may find, however, that the equipment, scientists, and even \prof are not entirely what they seem.

    The Player Characters (PCs) are on Sullust to deliver a small crate of Rebellion emergency beacons. The Cobalt Front is not formally a member of the Rebellion; the materials are a gesture of good will to woo them into closer affiliation. If this particular item does not fit with your groups interests, feel free to replace it with an appropriate substitute (weapons, medicines, other tech, etc.).
\emph{Goal}: Recover critical research equipment so it does not fall into the ``wrong'' hands.\\
\emph{Challenge}: (spoiler) \prof is actually an alien infiltrator.  She is using the PCs to steal equipment as her alien form would be detected.\\

\subsection{Encounter List}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Dead Student (information)
    \item Conference Arrival (social)
    \item Biokinetic Waveform Analyzer (social/information)
    \item Crossing The Border (social/stealth)
    \item Facility Infiltration (stealth/combat)
    \item Entity Extraction (stealth/chase)
    \item Oral Defense (social/combat)
    \item Aftermath
\end{enumerate}

\section{Dead Student}

Start the session by noting that one member of \prof's research group recently died on campus without explanation, supposedly due to a sudden medical condition.  If one of the characters was not chosen by the players, make it that one.  Otherwise, ask the players each one detail about the now deceased student.

    This encounter is primarily for the characters to establish Ares University and become more comfortable in the Cold War setting.  Each PC has an opportunity to use one skill to learn a little about what happened to their colleague before the conference Encounter starts.  If they're unsure what to try, here are some possibilities you can suggest:

    \begin{GenesysTable}{p{1.5in}p{2in}}
    Approach & Information to learn\\
    \df\df \textbf{Charm} the Nurses Group & Paramedics who declared
    student dead were not the usual crew\\
    \df\df \textbf{Streetwise} at Hades Club & Rumor is that student
    was poisoned\\
        \df\df \textbf{Stealth} to check \prof's office & Student had meeting with \prof just before death\\
    \df\df \textbf{Knowledge (Lore)} \hskip1em in Student's Room & ``Conspiracy Board'' suggests Student found out some secret about \prof (not written here) \\
\end{GenesysTable}

The PCs might talk to \prof.  She is an older woman, possibly in her seventies with light tan, almost leathery, skin.  She has only one leg and so gets around in a wheelchair.  Her slight central European accent and disability fuel rumors that she was a Nazi scientist during the war, but escaped to the Allies when it ended.  She never directly answers questions about that time, and most people are polite enough not to ask.

If the PCs ask \prof about the death directly, she demurs, ``I understand this is hard on all of us.  But they would have wanted us to honor their memory by furthering our research.  Are you all set to travel to Berlin?''.

\prof is really an alien Viper (i.e. snake person) masquerading as a scientist.  She actually did infiltrate the Third Reich as they were the first human nation to somewhat successfully make alien contact.  She has no interest in that ideology, but it provided a cover for her to continue infiltrating after the war.  Her one leg is actually a cover for her snake-like tail.  Alien genetic engineering is only so attuned to humans at this point, so she takes care to keep it hidden.  Her name is always rendered in lowercase, as ``allen'' very nearly ``alien'', though no-one in-universe should consider this unusual.

The dead student had discovered her identity (or something close to it), so she killed him with her venom and covered it up.  She \emph{is} ruthless, but her mission is primarily infiltration and preventing leaks of alien information.

\section{Conference Arrival}

The PCs are attending the "Conference on Physical Psychology" held in West Berlin.  This is a very diverse but academic conference.  There will be talks and researchers at a variety of technical levels and disciplines.  The PCs are staying at the hotel where the conference is held.

After settling into their rooms (\df\df Social check if a PC wants to share a room with \prof), \prof speaks to them furtively,

\begin{quoting}
    I'm glad all of you are able to attend this conference, but I have small favor to ask.  Another research group is presenting ideas on a Biokinetic Waveform Analyzer.  This is extremely dangerous technology, and they've secreted been working on a prototype.  We can't let this technology fall into the \emph{wrong hands}.  I need you to find and recover the prototype.
\end{quoting}

If the PCs ask questions, have them make a \df\df social check (probably \textbf{Charm}, but it depends on how they ask).  Even though this is against \prof, don't upgrade this check as she is expecting them to want a few more details.

On Success:
\begin{itemize}
    \item ``The research group experimenting with this technology are some of my...former colleagues in the Reich.  But they were true believers; the bastards will use it to raise a Fourth Reich!''
    \item \advantage \prof also shares, ``During the war, the Nazis made many dangerous scientific advances.  Their remnants, my former colleagues, are trying to deploy this technology to restore their empire.  I represent an extranational organization, EXCALIBUR, dedicated to stopping them.''
    \item \triumph \prof advises that the Nazis scientists likely have a captive connected to their research.
    \item \threat\threat PCs may make a \df\df \textbf{Vigilance} check to notice someone slipping away nearby.  They must have been listening to their conversation.
\end{itemize}

If not already mentioned, \prof thanks the PCs,

\begin{quoting}
    I appreciate your initiative in this matter.  I hate to have to involve you, but they know me well, and I'm not as spry as I once was.  You might start at the presentation tomorrow morning.  Your efforts will ensure the future of the planet.
\end{quoting}

\section{Biokinetic Waveform Analyzer}

As the conference proper begins, the PCs should try to learn more about the dangerous technology.  While attending the official talk (titled, ``Biokinetic Waveform Analyzer'') is an obvious method, there are several possible ways to learn more.  Feel free to mix what information is learn via what method, and offer more with Advantage.

    \begin{GenesysTable}{p{1.5in}p{2in}}
    Approach & Information to learn\\
        \challenge\df \textbf{Knowledge (Science)} to understand talk & Technology could detect lifeforms and basic information about them.\\
    \df\df\df \textbf{Charm} to schmooze with academics & Technology has extreme computational cost, far beyond current capabilities. \\
    \df\df \textbf{Perception} to eavesdrop rumors & Device is being held in East Berlin, to be transferred tomorrow morning.\\
    \challenge\df \textbf{Skulduggery} to access back room of conference & Find device storage address scribbled on note in trash, warehouse in East Berlin.  \\
\end{GenesysTable}


\section{Crossing The Border}

\section{Facility Infiltration}

\section{Entity Extraction}

\section{Oral Defense}

\section{Aftermath}

Recommended XP: 5 per major encounter, so probably 25-35 depending on how much time the party spent on various aspects of the adventure.  If running as a one-shot (as during a convention), consider awarding XP at the end of each encounter to be spent right away.  This can give players a sense of progression even within a single adventure.
