# Secret Background

## Woman in Disguise

You are actually a woman in disguise as a man.  You are determined to do your part in this war, directly.  Being found out would mean court martial, imprisonment, or worse.

Start with a disguise kit.

## German Ancestry

Though you are German by birth, you have no sympathy for the atrocities committed by your homeland.  But, no one trusts a turncoat, so you insist any accent is actually from an obscure central European country.  Everyone seems to believe you, but you can feel their doubts.

Your character speaks fluent German.

## Communist Sympathizer

While the USSR is officially an equal partner in the Allies, a cloud of suspicion hangs over them.  While not Russian yourself, you feel the plight of the workers and take direction from ComIntern.  But such talk in the wrong ears could mean expulsion or worse.

Start with a smoke grenade.

## Pacifist

You support resisting Fascism, but you know war is wrong.  You do all you can to prevent violence, but direct opposition to the war will only get you imprisoned, at best.

Start with a medkit.

# Secret Goal

## Hunt Treasure

War is hell and pay is crap, but you can come out ahead.  Rather than let valuables be looted or scrapped for more tanks, you should keep them safe.  It belongs in a museum (or maybe your bank account).

Start with a whip (+1 dmg Melee, but works at short range, Ensnare 1.  Also usable narratively for Atheletics, Coordination, and other skill checks).

## Take Revenge

The Wehrmacht has taken so much from you, family, friends, or livelihood.  But the tide of war is finally turning.  It's time to make the Germans pay for what they did.

One of your weapons gains Vicious 2 (+20 to crit results).

## Build a Legend

Sun Tzu.  Alexander the Great.  The Red Baron.  You might be mortal, but your name can live on forever in your deeds.  Do something unbelievable that people will remember.

Once per session, add 2 boost dice to a dice pool before you roll.

## Protect the Flock

The bond with your squadmates is tighter than blood.  You've lost one member already; you cannot bear even the thought of losing another.  You will do whatever you can to ensure everyone survives the war.

When you take the Aid Another maneuver or receive aid, add an extra boost die to the pool.
