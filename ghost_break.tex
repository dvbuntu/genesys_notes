\section{Intro}
(North Africa, 1942)\\

    PCs are allied 2nd stringers (33rd Lowland Division), worn out from weeks of fighting Rommel in the desert.  Things were finally looking up as Montgomery's Eighth Army finally clawed back some territory from the Axis.  But Rommel has been desperate, meddling with dark forces and tombs long covered by the sand.  Worse than breaking into such a reliquary is breaking out\cdots.

Stuff around the camp, maybe someone telling ghost stories

Sergeant Slattery, total hardass.

PCs on latrine duty as ``light work''

All-American Super Squad just leaving, mocking PCs saying they just ``left a deposit'' for the party to clean up.

    \subsection{Adventure Limitations}

    War has been straining the 8th Army beyond the breaking point.  Few supplies are available, morale is nearly rock-bottom, and the campaign drags on.  But, they have tasted their first crucial victory and are battled tested veterans.
    
    During this adventure, PCs face the following global modifiers:

    \begin{itemize}
        \item Rationed supplies, \Threat\Threat is enough to run out of ammo or other limited use items (med kits, flares, etc).  Scrounging may recover additional ammo or supplies
        \item Low Morale, \Despair causes all \emph{other} party members to suffer one strain in addition to normal effects
        \item Turning point, Aid Another maneuver adds an extra \Advantage\Advantage in addition to normal benefits
    \end{itemize}

\section{Benign Transposition}

ghost - ancient spirit, maybe summoned by Rommel's occult detachment.  Unbound since axis retreated, but desperately needs to escape the tomb, or PCs will share their fate.

ghost spends last bit of vigor weirdly teleporting PCs from surface to within tomb.  To get out themselves, PCs need to get ghost out safely.

\df\df\df Resilience to avoid retching at sudden motion
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \Failure Suffer wounds equal to number of failures (min 2)
        \item \Advantage +\bbb to resist the incorporeal check
        \item \Triumph As shifting, either manage to bring useful piece of special equipment with you, or stumble upon some (possibly ancient/occult) immediately
        \item \Despair Some \emph{part} of you is still in the ether.  Upgrade difficulty of incorporeal check.
    \end{itemize}


It is completely dark.  There are no sounds of the typical encampment.  A brief sobbing wail wanes nearby as the ghost laments what it had to do.

social interaction with ghost can reveal info about nazi occult experiments and possibly dangers of the tomb, mix of ancient mechanical traps and leftover Nazi occult experiments

    occult check may reveal nature of ghost (summoned spirit, not some long-serving guardian).  powerful but slowly recharging abilities

\ch\df Discipline to maintain corporeal existence
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \Failure Lose full connection to material reality.  +\stb for next encounter as slowly rematerialize completely.
        \item \Advantage See something interesting while phasing.  +\bbb to Perception (may be occult aligned)
        \item \Triumph Limited control of phasing between planes with \df\df\df Discipline check
        \item \Despair Still phasing in and out.  May phase out at an inopportune time chosen by the GM, lasting for 1 round of structured time
    \end{itemize}

ghost is bound to this room by occult wards, and will only help PCs out if they let him out.

\df\df Knowledge to ascertain nature of occult wards
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \Success Clearly German design, +\abd to remove
        \item \Advantage Other German scribblings here as well, translated, ``I can't believe we're supposed to tunnel behind the allied lines through this god forsaken tomb''
    \end{itemize}

\df\df\stb\stb Skulduggery to safely break the ward
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \Advantage Able to repurpose some occult component
        \item \Failure Suffer 5 wounds as occult energy zaps you
    \end{itemize}

\section{Uphill Battle}

A windy staircase leads up to a larger chamber, dry from thousands of years of desert.  Sand is everywhere, mixed with more recent German equipment.  Curiously, the retreating forces still left a few lights on.

\df\df\stb Perception to search the room for clues
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \Success Find misc electronics and occult equipment buried in sand.   Strangely large number of dog treats (or maybe lunar diagrams).
        \item \Advantage Westward tunnel was collapsed on purpose, signs of explosives.
        \item \Advantage Find extra ammo/other supplies
        \item \Threat\Threat disturb a Scarab Swarm (see below)
    \end{itemize}

\npc{Scarab Swarm}{1}{4}{1}{1}{1}{1}{20}{1}
\npccontinued{0}{0}{
   Skills:
   \begin{itemize}
       \item Brawl 2
       \item Coordination 2
   \end{itemize}
   Abilities:
   \begin{itemize}
       \item Sharp mandibles - +2 brawl damage
       \item Swarm - Unless blast or burn, halve damage before applying soak
       \item Venomous Stinger - If Scarab Swarm successfully hits a character, that character must make at \df\df Resilience check or be disoriented (+\setback) for 3 rounds.
   \end{itemize}}

Two apparent ways out, tunnel up and tunnel ``west'' (if you have a compass).  Westward tunnel is collapsed in.

\df\df\df Vigilance to listen for faint howling
